Description copied from class: RecyclerView.Adapter Called when RecyclerView needs a new RecyclerView.ViewHolder of the given type to represent an item.
This new ViewHolder should be constructed with a new View that can represent the items of the given type. You can either create a new View manually or inflate it from an XML layout file.
The new ViewHolder will be used to display items of the adapter using onBindViewHolder(RecyclerView.ViewHolder, int, List). Since it will be re-used to display different items in the data set, it is a good idea to cache references to sub views of the View to avoid unnecessary View.findViewById(int) calls.
Specified by:
onCreateViewHolder in class Adapter
Parameters:
parent - The ViewGroup into which the new View will be added after it is bound to an adapter position.
viewType - The view type of the new View.
Returns:
A new ViewHolder that holds a View of the given view type.

Description copied from class: RecyclerView.Adapter Called by RecyclerView to display the data at the specified position. This method should update the contents of the RecyclerView.ViewHolder.itemView to reflect the item at the given position.
Note that unlike android.widget.ListView, RecyclerView will not call this method again if the position of the item changes in the data set unless the item itself is invalidated or the new position cannot be determined. For this reason, you should only use the position parameter while acquiring the related data item inside this method and should not keep a copy of it. If you need the position of an item later on (e.g. in a click listener), use RecyclerView.ViewHolder.getAdapterPosition() which will have the updated adapter position. Override onBindViewHolder(RecyclerView.ViewHolder, int, List) instead if Adapter can handle effcient partial bind.
Specified by:
onBindViewHolder in class Adapter
Parameters:
holder - The ViewHolder which should be updated to represent the contents of the item at the given position in the data set.
position - The position of the item within the adapter's data set.
